    "# MLB Roster Optimization for 2025 Season\n",

    "- **Maximizes total projected WAR (xWAR)** for 2025\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train the models** by running these notebooks (in order):\n",
    "   - `hitter_war_t_to_tp1_multiyear_backfill.ipynb` → saves `models/hitter_war_model.joblib`\n",
    "   - `pitcher_war_t_to_tp1_multiyear_optimized.ipynb` → saves `models/pitcher_war_model.joblib`\n",
    "   - `aav_regression.ipynb` → saves `models/hitter_salary_model.joblib` & `models/pitcher_salary_model.joblib`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepare the player data** by running:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python prepare_roster_data.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This generates `players.csv` with predicted 2025 xWAR and expected costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Julia Requirements**: Julia with packages `CSV`, `DataFrames`, `JuMP`, and `Gurobi`\n"
